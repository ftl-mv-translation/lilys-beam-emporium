    <text>Eldritch visions begin to cloud your sight, as a gigantic cruiser congeals in the space before you. A strangely familiar voice, although you have no idea from where, speaks to you.

			"Haha, Hahe! It's been so long, so long indeed! Hello again, dear friend! Tis I, The One Who Rhymes. As you already know, we are on the brink of new times! My master is here, awakened at last! Unlike anything ever before, now we're REALLY going to have a blast!" Despite never having seen the dancing, eldritch being before you, some dark place in the back of your mind seems to recall his unusual way of speaking, and his evil grin.</text>

Once, this plane was populated by countless eldritch beings much like myself. Unfortunately, their constant feuding led many of them to extinction. Now, all that's left is their dream matter to pollute the cosmos and feed my vermin. I frankly would have liked to take over the Multiverse with an army of gods, but oh well. A lesser and elder god of chaos will have to do."</text>

"Oh, so finally have arrived here as well? Right on time. You serve me so well, Lightbringer. 
As for you, Renegade... Thank you, dearest, for all the work in freeing me. Every good empress needs Her executioner, and with your firepower, you will fit perfectly.

And for whatever Slug pests that might still be alive in the nexus, I was really looking forward to pulling them apart, so let's get to business. And all shall know our wrath!"
